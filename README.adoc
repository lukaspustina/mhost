A modern take on the classic `host` DNS lookup utility including an easy to use, and very fast Rust lookup library.

== Features

* `mhost` is very fast and uses multiple DNS servers concurrently and aggregates all results for more reliable lookups.
* `mhost` supports classic DNS over UDP and TCP as well as modern DNS over TLS (DoT) and HTTP (DoH).
* `mhost` presents results in an easy, human readable format or as JSON for post-processing.
* `mhost` discovers host names, subdomains of any domain, as well as IP subnets in CIDR notation.
* `mhost` uses lints to validate the DNS configurations of any domain.
* `mhost` offers an easy to use Rust library so you can use the same lookup capabilities in your own project.

For details see sections <<Use-Cases,Use Cases>> and <<Documentation,Documentation>> of this Readme.

== Quick Start

. Install `mhost` â€“ see below for <<Installation,installation instructions>>.
. Run `mhost -p l --all -w github.com` and you've just asked 16 name servers for all available DNS records of _github.com_ in 34 ms. And in addition you get the WHOIS information for GitHub's subnet.
    image:doc/images/multi-lookup-all-records-github.png[Multi lookup for all available records of github.com.]
. Run `mhost -q -p --output json l --all -w github.com  | jq &#39;.lookups[] | .result.Response.records[]? | select(.type == &quot;A&quot;) | .data.A&#39;` and get all IPv4 addresses.
. Set shell alias `alias host=mhost l` to replace your system's `host` command.

== Use Cases

=== Just lookup an IP address

[source,bash]
----
mhost l github.com
----

image:doc/images/default-lookup-github.png[Default lookup for github.com.]

In this run, all default settings are applied. Especially, `most` uses only the local system's name servers and queries only the default record types.

=== Just lookup an IP address, using more than just your local name servers

[source,bash]
----
mhost -p l github.com
----

image:doc/images/default-lookup-predefined-servers-github.png[Default lookup with predefined servers for github.com.]

See, there're more answers than before!

`-p` add public name servers that `mhost` predefines for your convenience. By default, only the UDP is used to contact the predefined name servers. You can control this behaviour using `--predefined-filter` and filter for UDP, TCP, DoT, DoH. `--list-predefined` show all available predefined name servers.

=== Just lookup an IP address, using even more than just your local name servers

[source,bash]
----
mhost server-lists 'public-dns' -o servers.txt
mhost --limit 6000 --max-concurrent-servers 1000 --timeout 1 -f servers.txt l www.github.com
----

image:doc/images/default-lookup-servers-list-github.png[Default lookup with servers list for github.com.]

See, there're even more answers than before!

The first command downloads a list of public available name servers that are maintained by the https://public-dns.info[Public DNS] community. Usually only a subset of these are reachable, but it still a large set of active name servers.

The second command uses the name servers list from before and queries all of them concurrently. These settings are very aggressive and highly stresses your internet connection. `mhost` default settings are set much more cautiously.

=== Just lookup an IP address, using UDP, TCP, DoT, and DoH

[source,bash]
----
mhost -s 1.1.1.1 -s tcp:1.1.1.1 -s tls:1.1.1.1:853,tls_auth_name=cloudflare-dns.com -s https:1.1.1.1:443,tls_auth_name=cloudflare-dns.com,name=Cloudflare -p l github.com
----

As already mentioned before, `mhost` supports DNS queries over UDP, TCP, DNS over TLS (DoT), as well as DNS over HTTPS (DoH). In the above example, `mhost` uses all four protocols to query Cloudflare's name servers. 

This command also shows the syntax for name server specification, which in general is `protocol:&lt;host name | ip address&gt;:port,tls_auth_name=hostname,name=human-readable-name`.

image:doc/images/default-lookup-all-protocols-github.png[Default lookup with all protocols for github.com.]

=== Discover a domain

Sometimes you want to know which host names and subdomains a domain has. `mhost` offers a simple command to help you find these. Please mind, that `mhost` only uses DNS specific discovery methods. If you want even deeper discoveries using Google, Shodan etc. there are other tools available.

[source,bash]
----
mhost -p d github.com -p
----

This command uses the predefined name servers to discover the GitHub domain. The `-s` reduces all discovered names to real subdomains of `github.com.`.

image:doc/images/discover-github.png[Discover github.com.]

You can go one more step and explore the autonomous systems GitHub uses. In order to discover those, you can use the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
mhost -p l --all -w github.com
mhost -p l --all 140.82.121.0/24
----

image:doc/images/discover-as-github.png[Discover AS of github.com.]

=== Check your name server configuration

[source,bash]
----
mhost -p c github.com -p
----

image:doc/images/check-github.png[Check github.com.]

== Installation

=== From Source

Please install Rust via https://www.rustup.rs[rustup] and then run

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/lukaspustina/mhost
cd mhost
make install
----

== Documentation

`mhost` has three main commands: _lookup_, _discover_, and _check_. _lookup_ lookups up arbitrary DNS records of a domain name. _discover_ tries various methods to discover host names and subdomains of a domain. _check_ uses lints to check if all records of a domain name adhere to the DNS RFC.

=== Architecture Design Records

The subdirectory file://doc/adr[doc/adr] contains Architecture Design Records (ADRs) for this project. Record keeping has started during the project so not all decisions have been recorded. I still hope they will help everybody interested including me to understand the rational of design decisions.

== Changelog

Please see the link:CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG] for a release history.

== Limitations

* Currently `mhost` only supports class `IN`.
* Only a limited set of DNS record types is supported.
* The Docker test environment only works completely on Linux due to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#known-limitations-use-cases-and-workarounds[limitations] in Docker for macOS.

== Thanks

Thanks to https://github.com/bluejekyll[Benjamin Fry] for his literally wonderful http://trust-dns.org[Trust-DNS] server and the corresponding client library which does all the heavy DNS lifting of `mhost`.

== Postcardware

You're free to use `mhost`. If you find it useful, I would highly appreciate you sending me a postcard from your hometown mentioning how you use `mhost`. My work address is
