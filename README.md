# mhost

## Limitations

* Currently `mhost` only supports class `IN`.
* Only a limited set of DNS record types is supported.
* The Docker test environment only works completely on Linux due to [limitations](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#known-limitations-use-cases-and-workarounds) in Docker for macOS.

## Documentation
